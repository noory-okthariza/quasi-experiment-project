# quasi-experiment: matching design
I am starting a project related to the recent 2024 Indonesian election. My goal is to evaluate the extent to which President-elect Prabowo Subianto's victory is a function of Jokowi's support. The theoretical framework will draw largely from 'follow the leader' literature, and the design will employ propensity score matching and inverse propensity weighting to estimate the effect of Jokowi's vote in 2019 (assigned as the treatment) on Prabowo's victory in 2024. A set of covariates balance check will be presented, and the guided causal graph will be used as part of the data-generating process.
